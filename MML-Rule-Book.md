# MML RULEBOOK

## I. GENERAL INFO

### A. Entry Fee

The entry fee is 500kr (SEK) for each season played, **to be paid no later than the start of week 1**. The entry fee is subject to change upon approval via 2/3^rd^ majority vote.

The fees are divided between payout (250) and league connected activities such as draft, mid-season party and post-season award party.

The commissioner will be in charge of the price money and payout while the social money and the use of it will be handled by the social committee.

Failure to pay the league fee before the start of week 1 will result
in a -15 point penalty each week not paid.

### B. Payouts

The top 2 finishers receive payouts as well as the winner of regular season net proceeds (12 x 250)

1st Place: **1500kr.** with custody of the MML trophy until next season

2nd Place: **750kr.**

Winner of regular season: **750kr.**

Last Place: Custody of Matt’s Molestation Trophy until next season.

### C. Rule Changes during the Regular Season

Any proposed rule changes during the regular season can only be
implemented immediately if ALL owners voted unanimously to do so. If at
least one owner does not approve of the immediate rule change, then the
rule proposal shall take place the following season unless approved
otherwise. Any clarifications to rules to address ambiguities can be
approved midseason by a majority vote of the owners.

## II. DRAFT INFORMATION

### A. Draft Format

The format that will be used is snake draft where the order of picks reverses after each round. The reason for this is so the owner who gets the 1st overall pick, does not get that 1st pick advantage in every round, thus making the pool unfair among competitors.

Example:

```
When having 12 fantasy players in your snake draft, so the 1st round of picks go in order starting from 1-12.
You got lucky and received the #1 overall pick in the snake draft which means you have first crack at any player you want once the draft begins in round one.
You draft your player and the picks carry on until you get to the very last team in the 10th spot. Once that pick is in Round 2 will begin.
Team #12 will now have the 13th pick (or 1st pick of round 2) and you will have to wait till last pick of round 2 to make your 2nd player selection.
```

The MML drafts 23 rounds.

### B. Draft Rules

- The draft will take place on (TBD). Time tentatively set for (TBD)

- The draft consists of (TBD) rounds.  Each team has 5 minutes per
  selection, any grace time added is up to the commissioner.

- Going beyond the allotted time (5 minutes plus any commissioners
  grace time) will result in the owner surrendering their pick to the
  will of the league (_or auto-draft if available_). The league will
  decide the owners pick based on majority assumption of what position
  the owner is in need of (no kickers allowed in this process). League
  balance is of importance, and the commissioner will decide the pick
  if the league cannot agree. _This rule also applies to owners who
  are not present or available for their pick._ ADP will be used to decide what player that should be auto-drafted for free rooster spots.

- Draft picks can be traded before or even during a live draft. Trades
  must be approved by all owners involved verbally (or via text) to
  the commissioner. If the trade is thought to be collusion, it will
  fall under the same rules as listed below (see section III-A, and
  section IV-A-Trade Vetoes).

- TBD weeks before the planned draft date should the maximum number of five (5) keepers be communicated to be selectable for final 3 keepers.

- The evening before the draft should the final 3 keepers be selected with draft value.

- An non-skill based competition (luck) will be the deciding factor of the order in the snake draft where the winner of the competition chooses what spot he like to draft in followed by the second place etc.

## III. OWNER CONDUCT

### A. Fair Play and Conduct

Any owner(s) suspected of collusion or unfair play by three or more
owners in the league will be put to a vote on whether they are guilty of
collusion/unfair play or not. Based on 2/3rds vote (8 out of 12; Votes
of “None/Abstain” are not allowed in this situation) of guilty and
severity of the infraction, the Commissioner will take action to undo
the results and apply the appropriate punishment to the owner(s)
involved. Voting should take no longer than (48) hours. The votes will
be private and handled by a third-party.

### B. Owner Participation

Active participation on all fronts is a key ingredient to any fun and
successful fantasy league. Participation in league votes, league
activities, and social interactions on the league facebook page and chat
group are strong encouraged. Prolonged un-involvement in these areas may
result in a vote for impeachment (see section III-C below) due to
inactivity. The MML strongly encourages active participation throughout
the season. If you are unable to participate in a league activity due to
extenuating circumstances, please advise the Commissioner in advance.

### C. Owner Impeachment

**Three** or more owners can call a vote for impeachment on any other
owner during the **off-season only**. The reason(s) for impeachment will
be submitted to the commissioner to determine if it will be
accepted/approved or not. If the commissioner decides to approve/accept,
a vote will be called and the names of the owners calling for
impeachment will be exposed. The number of votes needed to impeach is:
(**9)** out of (**11)** in favor of impeachment (_Not 12, because the
person in question is restricted from voting)._ The votes will be
private, and handled by a third-party. Since Impeachment is a serious
matter the polls will be open no longer than 1 week (7 days).

## IV. TRADES AND FREE AGENTS

### A. Trading

- Things to trade: Players, draft picks, unspent FAAB and waiver positions can be traded.

- Player Trade-back policy: 6 Week Minimum for any player to be traded back.

- Trade Deadline: TBD but before playoffs.

- Friendly wagers: Friendly wagers will be allowed as long as they do not compromise the balance of the league and the majority of owners in the league don’t disapprove of the owner’s actions.

**Trade Vetoes:** The Commissioner will decide whether all other owner trades, not including their own trade,is worthy of being vetoed. In the case that a trade involves the Commissioner, any owner who thinks that the trade the commissioner made is suspicious, "stinks of collusion", and/or is unfair to the integrity of the league must find the support of at least 3 other owners (4 total) and they must all announce their call to veto to the entire league then the rules in _section III-A_ (above) will be invoked.

Owners have 48 hours to call a vote to veto a trade involving the Commissioner.  Failure to request a veto vote within this applicable time limit means the trade is final.

### B. Free Agency

- Owners are allowed unlimited transactions per season.

- Whatever NFL.com allows you to do through the free agency and waiver system is permissible, subject to any specific abuse or manipulation rules set forth in the MML Rule Book.

- Waiver wire abuse: Adding and dropping players for the sake of locking them into the waiver wire is a form of waiver wire abuse. If it’s deemed the case, an owner who wished to take a player off the waiver but was prevented from doing so can request the waiver claim to the commissioner. The owner who abused the waiver wire will have their waiver access suspended for one week (or more based on the severity of the abuse).

- Process: The MML uses FAAB to bid for players that are electable (not owned by a team) where the highest bidder will win the player. The team need to have an open roster spot for the player or choose what player that should be dropped if the bid wins. In case of same value bid will the team with the highest order waiver order win.

- FAAB value: The MML will start with 100 FAABs (aka foreskins).
  - FAAB-value bids of 0 (zero) are allowed.
  - FAABs can be used as part of trades.
  - Unspent FAABs will be lost not be transferred to the next season.

## V. LINEUPS

## A. Submitting Starting Lineups

- Owners can make roster changes anytime up until the start of the game your player is playing in that week. NFL.com automatically locks the roster position of players as their games begin. All starting lineups must be made on NFL.com and will be handled in accordance with NFL.com’s lineup deadline rules. If NFL.com is not working or you do not have access to NFL.com’s website, you can give your lineup to the Commissioner via text, via email, via Skype, or via Facebook messenger.

- Failure to replace a prior starter locks them into your starting lineup and will make you eligible for a TBI (see section XIII-A).

### B. Roster Size

```
1 – Quarterback
2 - Running Back
2 - Wide Receivers
1 - Tight End
1 - Flex Player (can be either a WR or RB).
1 - Flex Player (can be either a WR or TE)
1 – Kicker
2 – Defensive Lineman
2 – Linebackers

```

### C. Position Guidelines

- A player’s position is based on the position listed for that player on NFL.com.

- Owners must start a minimum of:

```
 1 – QB, 2 – RBs, 2 – WRs, 1 – TE, 2 – FLEX, 1 – K, 2 – DL, 2 – LBs, 2 – DB.
```

### D. Injured Reserve

After the MML Draft and/or during the season, each team is allowed to
place two players on the Injured Reserve (IR).  This IR spot does not
count against your active roster. NFL players can be put on the IR if
they cannot play because of an injury (or other reasons). NFL.com's
system determines who is eligible for IR. If at any time a player is
re-activated by their NFL team and NFL.com, he can be moved from the IR
slot to the active roster. Each team will have (**2**) IR slots.

## VI. SCORING SYSTEM

NFL fantasy standard rules are used for fantasy scoring with a few
exceptions:

1.  Players receive 0.5 points for each reception (0.5 PPR).

2.  IDP scoring (See section XII)

3.  Kicker misses get negative points (except any kick over 50 yards).

- **Score system Adjustments:** All major scoring adjustments/tweaks
  made by the commissioner must be finalized before the NFL pre-season begins.

- **Score settings lock:** Once week 1 has begun the scoring system
  will not be altered unless voted on by the entire league. (See
  section I-C)

_See the league’s settings on the NFL.com website for more detailed
information_ <http://tmml.league.fantasy.nfl.com/league/1014629/settings>

### C. Owner leaves the League

In the event that an owner drops from the league, the commissioner will
maintain the ownerless team during the season. If the commissioner’s
team faces the ownerless team in a head-to-head match, the league’s
leading ‘Points For’ will decide the ownerless teams starting lineup.

A new owner will be brought in to the league to take over as GM for the
ownerless team as soon as possible. _Same rules apply during the off
season, including owner impeachment (See section III- C)._

  receive spots in the Playoffs, with the top 2 records receiving a
  first round bye.

- **Tie Breaker**: At the end of the regular season, teams are ranked
  based on win/loss/tie records. If two or more teams have identical
  win/loss/tie records, the following steps will be taken to break the
  tie:

  - Head-to-head (best win/loss/tie record in games between the tied
    teams).

  - Most net touchdowns in all games.

  - Coin toss

- **Championship Week:** The games played in Week 16 determine for prize payouts. The MML Champion receives MML trophy, and 1st place winnings. 2nd and winner of regular season receive their winnings as well. Last place receives Matt’s Molestation Trophy.

## IX. OFF-SEASON

**A. NFL.com and Keepers**

- Owners must manually set all their keepers.

- Any player an owner doesn’t want, just don’t add them as a keeper.
  _See below._

* Owners must have their 3 keepers chosen no later than 1 week before
  the next draft.

  - The players kept by each owner will be announced once the
    deadline is reached.

**B. MML Board**

To be able to run the league as smooth and fair as possible and keep people engaged are MML having a board that handles parts of the leagues business. The positions are nominated for and voted in by all of the members of the league.

There are 3 branches in the league board and you can choose to be a part of any position, but you can only be involved in one branch once all the voting is complete.

Positions:

- Content Crew (2 people)
  The two people on content will be responsible for creating in-season, weekly content for the league to enjoy/hate. Examples of content are the weekly articles from a few seasons ago, or a podcast from last season.
- Party/Activity Planning (2 people)
  The two people on party/activity planning will be responsible for planning and setting up events such as the draft + the draft challenge, get togethers/party, or other social events for the league.
- The Law (1 person)
  The person who proposes a new rule book to the league for the next season and person who enforces the rules and punishment. The rules proposed by this person will be voted on by the rest of the board. If no new rules are approved last seasons rules will carry over.

The league also has a commissioner that has the dividing vote when needed and the final word along with the administrative powers on the platform. The role as commissioner is, when changed, voted on separately and will always be part of the board.

## XI. CUSTOM LEAGUE AWARDS

### A. The Bloody Indian (TBI)

An owner that plays an injured/inactive/bye player in their starting
lineup will be given a TBI. The owner who received the TBI, will receive
the TBI trophy to their profile. Two TBI’s in
one season will result in punitive actions determined by the majority of
the league (funny/humiliating action, nothing to compromise the balance
of the league or outcome of matches/season results)

If the punishment is not completed before the weeks points are calculated by
NFL.com). Three TBI's in one season will result in an automatic -20
points from the owner’s weekly total. Four TBI's in one season will
result in another punitive action determined by the majority of the
league (funny/humiliating action, nothing to compromise the balance of
the league or outcome of matches/season results -20 points if the
punishment is not completed before the weeks points are calculated by
NFL.com). Five TBI's in one season will immediately start a vote for
impeachment (9 out of 11 to impeach) against the owner who received 5
TBI's (Article III.C \*doesn't have to be the off-season).

If the TBI happens in a game that are past midnight will the rule not be applicable (we all try to have a real life outside of fantasy)

## XII. KEEPER RULES

### A. Declaring your Keeper(s)

Owners must decide which (3) players they wish to keep no later than (1
week) before the draft. All players that are chosen to be a keeper will
be announced to the league so owners can begin deciding their strategy
for the next draft.

###B. Keepers and Their Cost

Owners will lose the draft pick(s) of the round(s) that the Keepers were
originally drafted at. Each season the player is marked as a Keeper,
their value will be doubled.

_Example_:
Player A is drafted in round 2, Player A is marked as a
Keeper before the next draft, the team that keeps Player A will lose
their 2^nd^ round pick in that draft. If Player A is marked as keeper
the season after that, the team that keeps Player A will lose their
1^st^ round pick.

\*Note: This cost carries over with trades and dropping. So when an
owner accepts a player in a trade the owner will also have to endure the
cost of the player if they choose to keep them.

### C. Multiple Keepers that are worth the same

Owners can end up keeping multiple players that could be worth the same
value (_Example:_ An owner has three players that are all worth a 1^st^
round pick). In this case the owner will lose the round of their worth
and the rounds after that to equal the number of players worth the same.

_Example_: An owner keeps three players worth round 1. The owner will
lose round 1, 2 and 3 of the next draft.

### D. Players not declared as a Keeper

All drafted players dropped during the season (placed into the
waiver/free agent pool) retain their drafted value until they are not
declared as a keeper.

_Example_: Team A drafts Player A in round 4. Half way during the season
Team A drops Player A onto the waiver wire. Team B picks up Player A off
of waiver. Team B chooses to keep Player A for the next season. Player A
costs Team B a 4^th^ round pick.

Any player that is not declared as a keeper is dropped off their team
and placed into free agency and all past worth of the player is removed.

_Example_: Player A was drafted in round 6 two seasons back. This season
Player A is now worth a 3^rd^ round pick. Player A is not declared as a
keeper. Player A is now worth whatever round they are drafted in.

### E. **Waiver wire Keepers**

If a player was _NOT_ drafted and they are acquired off the waiver wire
they are equal to the worth of the final round of the draft if they are
declared a Keeper.

If a player _WAS_ drafted and they are acquired off the waiver wire they
are equal to the round at which they were drafted.
